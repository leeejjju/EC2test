# EC2 test 


This is a repository for practicing CI/CD on an EC2 container server

> using Django & Python, EC2, Github Action


when I modify code and COMMIT & PUSH to repository, then automatically...



1. build application into a Docker image

2. push the image built into DockerHub

3. access the EC2 instance with ssh 

4. run Docker container with updated Docker Image 



finally, we can access the application with EC2 Public IP address :D
