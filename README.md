# EC2 test 


this is repository for practice CI/CD on EC2 container server 


when I modify codes and commit, push on repository, then automatically...



1. build application to Docker image

2. push Image builed into DockerHub

3. access to EC2 with ssh 

4. run Docker container with updated Docker Image
